# Formalized Orthologic Reasoning with Memoization and Reference Equality
This repository contains the formalization in Coq of the main result of [Orthologic with Axioms](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/0bf03832-b873-44e1-8286-4301ecc42709) (the cut elimination theorem for orthologic), and the implementation of an algorithm deciding orthologic inequalities, optimized using memoization and reference equality: The optimized algorithm is proven correct, and lifted to a Coq tactic using reflection.

### Technical details
This formalization has been carried using Coq 8.18. The project can be rebuilt at once using `make`.

### Reference Paper
Preprint, TBD
